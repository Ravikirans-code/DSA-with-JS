## Phase 5: Practice and Mock Interviews (Days 81-90)

### Day 81-85: Daily Problem Practice
- Solve 3-4 problems daily on platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).
- Focus on a mix of easy, medium, and hard problems.

### Day 86-88: Mock Interviews
- Use tools like [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com) or pair with a friend to simulate coding interviews.

### Day 89-90: Review and Consolidation
- Revise key concepts.
- Practice explaining your solutions clearly.
