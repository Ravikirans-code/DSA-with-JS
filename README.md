- **Mock Interviews**:
  - Use tools like [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com) for peer interviews.
  - Practice explaining solutions.

---

## **Tips for Success**
- **Consistency**: Dedicate 1-2 hours daily to learning and practice.
- **Practise and Test**: Use tools like [VisuAlgo](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) for test your knowldge.
- **Visualization Tools**: Use tools like [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net) for visual understanding.
- **Code Regularly**: Write implementations in plain JavaScript.
- **Join Communities**: Engage with coding groups for motivation and help.
